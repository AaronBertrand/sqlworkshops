#### <i>A Microsoft Workshop from the SQL Server team</i>

<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid lightgrey;"></p>

<img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="./graphics/textbubble.png"> <h2>About this Workshop</h2>

Welcome to this Microsoft solutions workshop on SQL Server in on-premise, in-cloud and hybrid solutions. In this one-day workshop, you'll gain a deep understanding on the latest SQL Server engine and how you can use it to solve real-world challenges. 

The modules in this workshop lead you through conceptual and hands-on topics ranging from the newest technical features in SQL Server to its implementation in all platforms it runs on. You'll learn not only specific technologies, but how to assemble them into a complete solution based on customer needs and requests.   

You'll start by learning about the latest improvements to SQL Server, move on to the Big Data Clusters configuration, and then learn about the ways you can leverage SQL in Microsoft Azure - all with a focus on how to extrapolate what you have learned to create other solutions for your organization. You'll end the day with a "What to Use When" module explaining how to create your own solutions. 

This README.MD file explains how the workshop is laid out, what you will learn, and the technologies you will use in this solution.

Many organizations are faced with an aging or under-engineered data platform strategy. You need a plan for how to decide if, when, and how you should upgrade your systems, when to extend them to the cloud, what to keep on and what can work in a hybrid fashion.

Members from the Azure SQL Product Group will lead you through the data estate options from Microsoft, from on-premises SQL Server (including some of the new features in SQL Server) to Relational Database options in Azure. You'll how to evaluate the benefits/costs of each technology option, and give you multiple tools that you can take home to inventory, evaluate, and migrate your current data platform environment to the best configuration.

This course contains lecture and hands on lab work, and is particularly useful for Solution Architects, Data Architects, Application Architects, Technical Sellers, and Application Developers. BYOD and experience with SQL is considered a prerequisite.

<img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="./graphics/checkmark.png"> <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

In this day-long, hands-on workshop youâ€™ll learn how to:

<br>

 - Articulate the key differentiators between SQL Server on-prem, in Azure VM, in Azure SQL DB, and hybrid
 - Explain the different service tiers within Azure SQL DB, and what to choose when
 - Understand how Azure SQL DB is secured and address security concerns
 - Learn what hybrid entails for Azure SQL DB and SQL Server in some common examples
 - Get hands on with some of the features in SQL Server and Azure SQL DB
 - Understand "other" Azure platform features 
 - Understand what services are available to migrate and modernize your entire SQL Server stack
 - Make informed decisions about how your business or customers should modernize their data estate

<img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="./graphics/building1.png"> <h2>Business Applications of this Workshop</h2>

Businesses require near real-time insights from ever-larger sets of data from a variety of sources. Many have not explored teh improvements made in the latest versions of SQL Server, and some are only now exploring the cloud as a computing platform. As time has progressed, a more dramatic upgrade process may be required.

In addition to traditional Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) and Online Analytic Processing (OLAP) workloads, some industry examples of data processing from multiple sources of data at scale are in Retail (Demand Prediction, Market-Basket Analysis), Finance (Fraud detection, customer segmentation), Healthcare (Fiscal control analytics, Disease Prevention prediction and classification, Clinical Trials optimization), Public Sector (Revenue prediction, Education effectiveness analysis), Manufacturing (Predictive Maintenance, Anomaly Detection) and Agriculture (Food Safety analysis, Crop forecasting) to name just a few.

The information coverecd in this workshop includes the following technologies and topics - although you are not limited to these, they form the basis of the workshop. At the end of the workshop you will learn how to extrapolate these components into other solutions. You will cover these at an overview level, with references to much deeper training provided.

<img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="./graphics/owl.png"> <h2><a name="prereqs">Before Taking this Workshop</a></h2>

You'll need a local system that you are able to install software on. The workshop demonstrations use Microsoft Windows as an operating system and all examples use Windows for the workshop. Optionally, you can use a Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine (VM) to install the software on and work with the solution.

You must have a Microsoft Azure account with the ability to create assets, specifically the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

This workshop expects that you understand data structures and working with SQL Server and computer networks. This workshop does not expect you to have any prior data science knowledge, but a basic knowledge of statistics and data science is helpful in the Data Science sections. Knowledge of SQL Server, Azure Data and AI services, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks is recommended. AI techniques are implemented in Python packages. Solution templates are implemented using Azure services, development tools, and SDKs. You should have a basic understanding of working with the Microsoft Azure Platform.

If you are new to these, here are a few references you can complete prior to class:

-  [Microsoft SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/database-engine-tutorials?view=sql-server-ver15)
-  [Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/)
