Calls the Launchpad service.\r\n - Launchpad (*launchpad.exe*) - Service/Daemon that executes and manages the external script process. Calls a Launcher DLL specific to the Language.\r\n - Launcher DLL (*RLauncher.dll* for R, *PythonLauncher.dll* for Python): Extension for each language. Calls the language executable environment.\r\n - R, Python, Java:\tThe environments that run the languages for Machine Learning. The specific versions, editions, releases and bit-levels are installed for you by the SQL Server Installer, even if you have them installed already. Calls a *BxLServer*.\r\n - BxlServer (*bxlserver.exe*): Manages communication between SQL Server and external languages using *Windows Job Objects*. Receives and makes calls from and to the *SQL Satellite*.\r\n - SQL Satellite (*sqlsatellite.exe*): Handles input and output variables and data exchange, including basic data type resolution and error handling (**Note: you should still explicitly control data type transformations in code**) Receives and makes calls to and from the *SQL Server* process.\r\n\r\nIf selected, the Installer program for SQL Server installs the Microsoft ML Server-supported language runtime environments *alongside* the SQL Server Instance, and then sets up a Service (the *SQL Launchpad*) allowing the sandboxed processes to communicate over a secure channel. It also sets up several other components to allow the *scoring*, and in some cases the *training*, of Machine Learning models using Python or R. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/advanced-analytics/media/generic-architecture.png?view=sql-server-2017\">\r\n",

You can create your R or Python code on a workstation with the Microsoft R or Python Libraries installed, which run certain operations on the SQL Server Instance remotely.\r\n2. You can \"wrap\" the R or Python code in a Stored Procedure server-side, and run standard Transact-SQL statements to call for the scoring.\r\n\r\nYou can use four methods of running the Models you create in Machine Learning Services (in SQL Server 2019):\r\n\r\n1. Using the Extensibility Framework, you can create trained Machine Learning Models, and store them as a binary object in a SQL Server table. You can then \"score\" (do the predictions or classifications) in SQL Server by loading the binary model and using it in Python or R code wrapped in a Stored Procedure.\r\n2. Using the Native Scoring feature of the `PREDICT` Transact-SQL statement against a trained Machine Learning Model. The model that you use must have been created using one of the supported algorithms from the RevoScaleR package. \r\n3. Using the `sp_rxPredict` stored procedure provided as a wrapper for the `rxPredict` R function in RevoScaleR and MicrosoftML, and the `rx_predict` Python function in revoscalepy and microsoftml. It is written in C++ and is optimized specifically for scoring operations.\r\n4. The *big data clusters* (BDC) feature provides not only the ML Server processes, but adds a Spark environment for *SparkR, PySpark, SparkML* and other libraries for Machine Learning over HDFS and database data.  This course focuses on the previous three methods, but a [full course on using BDC is here](https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlworkshops/tree/master/sqlserver2019bigdataclusters).\r\n ",
